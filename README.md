# What I have read since 2015

* **[My reading list since 2015](https://github.com/nikaburu/reading/blob/master/reading.md)**

## Record Format

```none
[Number]. _[Name]_ by [Author] [[tags]] [pages]pp/[hours:minutes] ([Read Date])
```

### Tags

```none
    # paper book
    @ - audiobook
    + e-book
    ^ re-read
    bold - five stars book
```

## Rules

1. Only books I finish go on the list. Each finished book gets a number.
1. Each book I re-read goes on the list again with another number.
1. Paper, e-books, and audiobooks all count, so long as I finish them.
1. Language of a record is the language in which I read this book (english | belarusian | russian).

## Origin

I started my list because I discovered [a list by Jamie Todd Rubin](https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list) recently. His list goes back to 1996, I have records of the books I read since 2015. I commited to read around 20 books a year so I've decided to keep consolidated tracking in similar way Jamie Todd Rubin does. I'm impressed by the jorney his list did through different forms. Many thanks to Jamie Todd Rubin for the idea and the format!
